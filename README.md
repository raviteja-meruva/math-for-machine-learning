# Mathematics for Machine Learning

This repository documents my study of **mathematical foundations essential for machine learning**,
with a focus on **intuition, clarity, and practical relevance** rather than heavy formal proofs.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Understand *why* machine learning algorithms work
- Build intuition behind model behavior and optimization
- Strengthen foundations required for ML, Deep Learning, and AI systems

This repository complements my Python and ML projects and evolves gradually alongside them.

## 📚 Topics Covered (Progressive)

- **Linear Algebra** – vectors, matrices, transformations, eigen intuition  
- **Probability** – random variables, distributions, Bayes theorem  
- **Statistics** – descriptive statistics, inference, hypothesis testing  
- **Optimization** – gradient descent, loss minimization  

Each topic is studied with **direct relevance to machine learning use cases**.

## 🎯 Philosophy

- Intuition over memorization  
- ML relevance over academic completeness  
- Simple explanations over complex notation  

This is a learning-first repository, not a reference textbook.
